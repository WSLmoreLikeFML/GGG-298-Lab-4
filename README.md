**Evidence** for a single promoter model was verified when ```viruses``` were exposed to UV light. UV radiation can cause dimerization of RNA, which prevents *transcription* by RNA polymerase. 
```
If the viral genome follows a multiple promoter model, the level inhibition of transcription should correlate with the length of the RNA gene.
```
However, the genome was best described by a single promoter model.

When paramyxovirus genome was exposed to UV light, the level of inhibition of transcription

was proportional to the distance from the [leader sequence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Five_prime_untranslated_region). 
>That is, the further the [gene](#Some-useless-lists) is from the leader sequence, the greater the chance of RNA dimerization inhibiting RNA polymerase.
